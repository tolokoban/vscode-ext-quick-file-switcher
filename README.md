# tolokoban-quick-file-switcher

This extension is a simple quick file switcher betwee files with the same prefix.

When activated, the extension extract the prefix of the active file in the editor.
The __prefix__ is the part of the file name before the first dot.

Here are some examples of prefixes (in bold):

- __button.__ tsx
- __button.__ test.tsx
- __button.__ module.css
- __button.__ jpg

And we switch to the next file in the list of all the files of the same folder with the same prefix.
